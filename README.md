#Overview
Welcome to ArchDo, an innovative tool designed to make home maintenance and improvement tasks easier, safer, and more precise. While the app currently does not support real-time visualization of hidden features, it allows you to display predefined BIM (Building Information Modeling) projects in Unity. Additionally, the app includes an image target feature, enhancing its AR capabilities.

#Core Features
#Predefined BIM Projects#: Visualize preloaded BIM models within the app, providing insights into various architectural features.
#Image Target AR#: The app includes an image target feature, enabling augmented reality experiences based on predefined images.
#MetaMask Integration#: Securely store and verify your home’s unique structural features on the blockchain through MetaMask.
#Use Cases
#Homeowners#: Manage and maintain your home with precision and confidence using preloaded BIM models.
#Real Estate Developers#: Offer potential buyers a tech-enhanced view of properties by showcasing predefined BIM projects.
#Contractors#: Utilize BIM models to improve accuracy and efficiency during renovations and repairs.
#Why MetaMask?#
MetaMask integration isn’t just about cryptocurrency. It’s about creating a secure, verifiable digital identity for your home. By registering your home’s unique architectural features or custom installations on the blockchain, you can create a secure digital record that’s useful for property sales, insurance claims, or custom renovations.
