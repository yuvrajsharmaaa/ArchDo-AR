ArchDo
Overview
Welcome to ArchDo, an innovative tool designed to simplify home maintenance and improvement tasks, making them safer, more efficient, and precise. While the app currently does not support real-time visualization of hidden features, it allows you to display predefined BIM (Building Information Modeling) projects in Unity. Additionally, it includes an image target feature, enhancing its augmented reality (AR) capabilities.

Core Features

Predefined BIM Projects: Visualize preloaded BIM models within the app, providing insights into various architectural features.
Image Target AR: Trigger AR experiences based on predefined images to enhance your visualization.
MetaMask Integration: Securely store and verify your home’s unique structural features on the blockchain through MetaMask.
Use Cases

Homeowners: Manage and maintain your home with precision by leveraging BIM models for insights into structural elements.
Real Estate Developers: Showcase properties using tech-enhanced BIM models, offering potential buyers a more detailed view.
Contractors: Improve accuracy and efficiency in renovations or repairs by using BIM models to understand architectural layouts.
Why MetaMask?
MetaMask integration goes beyond cryptocurrency by enabling secure, verifiable digital identities for your home. By registering your home’s unique architectural features or custom installations on the blockchain, you create a digital record useful for property sales, insurance claims, and renovations.
